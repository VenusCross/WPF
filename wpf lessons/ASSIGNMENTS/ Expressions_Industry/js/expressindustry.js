 // I work at a hospital people are weighed in kilograms let's convert their weight to pounds
 
 // Problem: Convert 179 kg to pounds
 
 
 var oneKg = 2.21 // one kilogram equals 2.21 lbs
 var ptWeightInKg = 179 // patient weight in kilograms
 var pounds = oneKg * ptWeightInKg // formula to get patient weight converted to pounds
 var total = pounds
 console.log("The patient weighs +"pounds"+"lbs".")
