 // I work at a hospital people are weighed by kilograms let's convert their weight to pounds
 
 // Problem: Convert 179 kg to pounds 
 
 
 var oneKg = 2.21 // one kilogram equals 2.21 lbs
 var ptWeightInKg = 179 // patient weight in kilograms
 var pounds = oneKg * ptWeightInKg // formula to get patient weight converted to pounds
 var total = pounds // this should be the total for the formula given
 console.log("The patient weighs "+total+"lbs.")// the answer to patients being weighed in kilograms converted to pounds
