var kindergartenStudents = 14 // number of students in class
var krispyKremeDonuts = 20 // number of donuts donated to kindergarten class
var remainder = krispyKremeDonuts % kindergartenStudents // formula to get answer for problem
console.log(remainder)// this will print the answer to the console for formula given
// trying the modulo (remainder) operator 


var kindergartenStudents = 69 // number of students in class
var krispyKremeDonuts = 111 // number of donuts donated to kindergarten class
var remainder = krispyKremeDonuts % kindergartenStudents // formula to get answer for problem
console.log(remainder)// this will print the answer to the console for formula given

// these are two examples no sure if done correctly
